obphyscator
===========

A rather simple email obfusctor for website that _encrypts_ 
an mailto link in JavaScript. I like to imagine this prevents
spam (and so far it actually did). 

I wrote sth. like that a least 3 times (in PHP) and always lost
it due to HDD crashes or things like that. And as it takes only 
little time to write it i never had a copy around. But now its
here.
